<!--In light of the Covid-19 pandemic and reduced opportunities for junior scholars to share early-stage work and meet fellow scholars, we are pleased to announce a new virtual forum for junior scholars. The first Workshop on the Political Economy of South Asia (WPESA) will be held online on **November 6-7, 2020**. -->

<!--We invite submissions that consider the political economy of South Asia, broadly defined, and encourage empirical work. In addition to article-length manuscripts, we also welcome well-developed research designs/PAPs.

<!--The workshop aspires to connect junior scholars working across political science, economics, and related fields. We particularly encourage researchers from South Asia to apply. Priority for limited presentation slots will be given to early career researchers, including graduate students, post-docs, and non-tenure-track faculty. We welcome more established scholars to join as participants and discussants.

<!--Each day of the workshop will feature 45-minute sessions, plus an optional social event, held over four hours. Each session will cover one paper. Presenters will give a brief presentation, followed by comments from the discussant and other participants. More format details to follow. The workshop will be held over Zoom from 7-11am PST for both days (10am-2pm Eastern,  3-7pm UK,  8pm-12am Pakistan,  8:30pm-12:30am India).
