# UNDER CONSTRUCTION! BEAR WITH US

Welcome to WPESA (Workshop on the Political Economy of South Asia), a new forum for early career scholars to share their work on South Asian political economy, broadly defined.

Our first workshop is coming soon, this November 13th-14th, on Zoom.

See our [**call for papers**](#answer-our-call-for-papers), volunteer to [**be a discussant**](#volunteer-as-a-discussant), or [**sign up for our mailing list**](#sign-up-to-attend) to join the WPESA community.
