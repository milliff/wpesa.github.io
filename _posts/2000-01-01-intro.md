Welcome to WPESA (Workshop on the Political Economy of South Asia), a new forum for early career scholars to share their work on South Asian political economy. We aspire to connect scholars across political science, economics, and related fields. 

Our second workshop is coming soon, this April 2-3, on Zoom. We invite submissions that consider the political economy of South Asia, broadly defined, and encourage empirical work. In addition to article-length manuscripts, we also welcome well-developed research designs/PAPs.

We particularly encourage researchers from South Asia to apply. Extra consideration will be given to those who attended our first meeting, and those who will contribute to community-building by attending all sessions. Presentation slots are reserved for early career researchers, including graduate students, post-docs, and non-tenure-track faculty. We welcome more established scholars to join as participants and discussants.
