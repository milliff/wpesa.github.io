Welcome to WPESA (Workshop on the Political Economy of South Asia), a new forum for early career scholars to share their work on South Asian political economy. We aspire to connect scholars across political science, economics, and related fields. 

Our second workshop is coming soon, this April 2-3, on Zoom.
