## Schedule of Events
{: .text-orange}

WPESA<sub>2</sub> will run 10am-2pm (US EDT) on April 2 and 3, 2021. 

Both days of the workshop will feature 45-minute sessions held over four hours. Sessions will cover one paper that will be provided two weeks ahead of time to all valid registered participants with institutional affiliations.

In each session, we will invite the discussant to begin with their comments (brief presentation optional) and allow the presenter to respond. Then, the majority of the time will be dedicated to comments from other participants.

In addition, we aim to hold an optional social event and a practitionersâ€™ panel.

Check back soon for a detailed schedule of presentations and events.
